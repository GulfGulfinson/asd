DailyLearn Project Principles

1. Code Quality
   - Write modular, reusable code with clear separation of UI, logic, and data access
   - Use TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability
   - Follow Clean Code principles (readable code, meaningful names)

2. User-Centered Design
   - Focus on simple, intuitive usability and quick achievement of learning goals
   - Consider accessibility (e.g., contrast, screen reader compatibility)

3. Performance
   - Minimize loading times through code splitting, lazy loading, and caching
   - Mobile First Design with fast response times

4. Security
   - Secure password storage (bcrypt), secure JWT processing
   - Protection against common web security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
   - GDPR compliance and data protection

5. Scalability
   - Design backend and data model to easily grow with new topics and user numbers
   - Use cloud hosting that supports auto-scaling

6. Testing and Automation
   - Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) where possible
   - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

7. Payment Integration
   - Implement secure and reliable payment processing (PCI DSS standards)
   - Transparent communication with users about payments and subscriptions

8. Maintainability and Extensibility
   - Code and API documentation
   - Separation of business logic and presentation
   - Enable flexible content management through admin interface

9. UX & Gamification
   - Motivate users through streaks, badges, progress indicators
   - Design push notifications to be non-intrusive

10. Offline Support
    - Users should have access to the last learning content even without internet
    - Reliable synchronization when returning online
